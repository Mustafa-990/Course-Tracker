# Course-Tracker
This project helps determine a students  progress towards meeting graduation requirements at DePauw. I did this as a part of my Data Structures Class.
For this Project data is stored in a linked list 
For this program, the user should be presented with a menu of options. Each bullet point below should be an option on the list. 
•	Insert a Course - the program should prompt the user to enter information about the course (department, number, and grade), then insert it into the linked list. It does not matter what order the courses appear in the list.
•	Display Course List (All) – the program should display information about all the courses in the list, in the order in which they are in the list.
•	Quit the Program - the program should end. The quit option should always be the last option, even when the options for stage two are added.
•	Remove a Course - the program should prompt the user to enter the department and course number for the course to remove, then remove it from the list. If it is not in the list, the program should not change the list.![image]
•	Calculate GPA – the program should calculate the GPA of the courses in the list. For this assignment, you can assume that all courses are one credit. The grade values to calculate GPA are: “A” = 4.00, “A-” = 3.67, “B+” = 3.33, “B” = 3.00, “B-” = 2.67, “C+” = 2.33, “C” = 2.00, “C-” = 1.67, “D+” = 1.33, “D” = 1.00, “D-” = 0.67, “F” = 0.00.
